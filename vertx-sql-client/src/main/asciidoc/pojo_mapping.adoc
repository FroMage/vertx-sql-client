The SQL client does not aim to be an ORM, nevertheless it provides simply support for mapping rows
to POJO (Plain Old Java Object).

For the moment, this feature is supported for reading:

- Simple queries
- Prepared queries
- Batch queries

The way it works is very simple, each row is converted to a JSON object keyed by row names.

You can provide a function that turns this JSON row into any object:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.SqlClientExamples#mapping01(io.vertx.sqlclient.SqlClient)}
----

You can also provide a class literal to let the underlying JSON mapper do the mapping for you:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.SqlClientExamples#mapping02(io.vertx.sqlclient.SqlClient)}
----

This is literaly mapping the JSON object to a POJO with {@link io.vertx.core.json.JsonObject#mapTo(java.lang.Class)}.
